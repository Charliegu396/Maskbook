# Popups

This entry is used to display some dialogs that must run in the chrome-extension:// protocol.

Do not be confused with popup-page, it actually means "browser-actions-page" and will be renamed in the future.

Components in this folder is intended to run in the chrome-extension:// protocol as a single page. But it can also be reused in the dashboard if it is needed.
